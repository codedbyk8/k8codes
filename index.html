            <h3>I am Passionate about Creating</h3>
              <p> After creating my own photography business I realized I was passionate about three things: collaborating, using my creative eye and learning. These passions set me on a new path towards web development via tools learned through Skillcrush. The skills I've learned let me continue to create photographs and impliment them in new ways. I can't wait to collaborate with <span>you.</span> </p>
